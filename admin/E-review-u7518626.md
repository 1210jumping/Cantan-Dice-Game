Component: Class "Viewer"

### Comments 
The best feature of these codes is not only concise but also efficient. There is no imperfection in the whole class. 
It's well-documented.
The class including the methods is also appropriate. I can easily know what specific purposes of these methods.
No doubt, the user can run the program and search and find what they want easily and smoothly
